        WRAP (Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production)

        Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production (WRAP) is a factory-based Certification Program for manufacturers of
        sewn
        products, including apparel, footwear and accessories. <br><br>WRAP is an independent, non-profit organization
        dedicated to the certification of lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing throughout the world. WRAP apparel
        certification is now a requirement by most garment retailers in the U.S.<br><br>The market place, the media, and
        the
        public increasingly demand that apparel be produced under conditions that respect the rights and comply with
        labor
        and environmental laws, and that meet other international standards. A WRAP certification is widely accepted by
        retailers, brand managers, licensers, as evidence that your facility is socially responsible. <br><br> The
        objective
        of the Apparel Certification Program is to independently monitor and certify compliance with the following
        standards, ensuring that a given factory produces sewn goods under lawful, humane, and ethical conditions. Note
        that
        it is not enough to subscribe to these principles; WRAP monitors the factory for compliance with detailed
        practices
        and procedures implied by adherence to these standards. <br><br>

        Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) was founded in 2003 for the purpose of developing the tools and
        procedures for the European Business Social Compliance Programs. Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) is
        the
        common European platform of retailers, industry and importing companies for monitoring and improving social
        standards in supplier countries for all consumer goods. The BSCI is based on the labour standards of the
        International Labour Organization (ILO) and other important international regulations like the UN Charter for
        Human
        Rights, as well as on national regulations. The Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) was officially
        launched
        on 30 <br>
        November 2004. It represents a coordinated effort by the European retail industry to <br>
        implement a harmonized code of conduct and improve working conditions in supplier countries on a voluntary
        basis.
        The driving force behind the BSCI is the Brussels -based Foreign Trade Association (FTA), which is the
        association
        for European commerce lobbying particularly on foreign trade issues.
        <br><br>

        <b>What are the benefits of the BSCI?</b>
        <br><br>
        The benefits of the BSCI as a broad and comprehensive monitoring system for social standards in the supply chain
        are
        numerous:
        <br>
        Synergy effects, reduction of multiple auditing thereby reducing costs are one characteristic.
        Factories/companies
        which are being audited can improve their competitiveness through improved social standards as better working
        conditions and an improved management system leads to better product quality, higher productivity, fewer work
        accidents, less sick leave producing more highly motivated workers and lower staff turnover. The result of this
        is
        an improvement ethically, but also economically for both involved employers as well as employees. The economic
        advantages in this respect - in parallel taking into account the objectives to reduce excessive overtime and
        raise
        salaries where necessary, have been shown in research studies in this field. Therefore, benefits of the
        individual
        company also have a positive effect on the broad public.
        <br><br>
        <b>Does the BSCI provide a certification?</b>
        <br><br>
        The BSCI is not a certification system and therefore does not issue a certificate. The BSCI provides a specific
        process with uniform management instruments for Members, suppliers, auditors and qualifiers. This approach
        ensures
        uniform audit procedures and evaluation and therefore comparability of the results. <br>
        If I do not get a certificate what do I receive as proof of the audit?<br>
        The cover page of the audit report outlining the results and the validity of the audit can be displayed in the
        factory premises and be used as proof of the audit. <br><br>

        <b>Which products are covered by the BSCI?</b>
        <br><br>
        Audits within the BSCI can be conducted in any production facility worldwide. <br>
        The type of articles covered by the BSCI varies widely. There are quite a number of department stores as
        members,
        who sell all sorts of soft goods, clothing, home textiles, small appliances, toys, and accessories. There are
        also
        members that focus on one particular product group, for example clothing stores, shoe retailers, baby products,
        or
        sports goods. For the implementation of the BSCI in the food industry, the BSCI has developed a special module
        for
        the primary production (farms) <br><br>
