    WRAP (Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production)

    Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production (WRAP) is a factory-based Certification Program for manufacturers of sewn
    products, including apparel, footwear and accessories. <br><br>WRAP is an independent, non-profit organization
    dedicated to the certification of lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing throughout the world. WRAP apparel
    certification is now a requirement by most garment retailers in the U.S.<br><br>The market place, the media, and the
    public increasingly demand that apparel be produced under conditions that respect the rights and comply with labor
    and environmental laws, and that meet other international standards. A WRAP certification is widely accepted by
    retailers, brand managers, licensers, as evidence that your facility is socially responsible. <br><br> The objective
    of the Apparel Certification Program is to independently monitor and certify compliance with the following
    standards, ensuring that a given factory produces sewn goods under lawful, humane, and ethical conditions. Note that
    it is not enough to subscribe to these principles; WRAP monitors the factory for compliance with detailed practices
    and procedures implied by adherence to these standards. <br><br>

    <b>Benefits of WRAP Certification</b>
    <br><br>

    The WRAP Certification program is grounded in the belief that factory based certification is the most effective way

    for improving work place conditions on those who own and operate sewn product manufacturing facilities. WRAP

    <br><br><br><br><br>

    <b style="color: #005a6a;">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</b>
    <br>

    Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) was founded in 2003 for the purpose of developing the tools and
    procedures for the European Business Social Compliance Programs. Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) is the
    common European platform of retailers, industry and importing companies for monitoring and improving social
    standards in supplier countries for all consumer goods. The BSCI is based on the labour standards of the
    International Labour Organization (ILO) and other important international regulations like the UN Charter for Human
    Rights, as well as on national regulations. The Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) was officially launched
    on 30 <br>
    November 2004. It represents a coordinated effort by the European retail industry to <br>
    implement a harmonized code of conduct and improve working conditions in supplier countries on a voluntary basis.
    The driving force behind the BSCI is the Brussels -based Foreign Trade Association (FTA), which is the association
    for European commerce lobbying particularly on foreign trade issues.
    <br><br>

    <b>What are the benefits of the BSCI?</b>
    <br><br>
    The benefits of the BSCI as a broad and comprehensive monitoring system for social standards in the supply chain are
    numerous:
    <br>
    Synergy effects, reduction of multiple auditing thereby reducing costs are one characteristic. Factories/companies
    which are being audited can improve their competitiveness through improved social standards as better working
    conditions and an improved management system leads to better product quality, higher productivity, fewer work
    accidents, less sick leave producing more highly motivated workers and lower staff turnover. The result of this is
    an improvement ethically, but also economically for both involved employers as well as employees. The economic
    advantages in this respect - in parallel taking into account the objectives to reduce excessive overtime and raise
    salaries where necessary, have been shown in research studies in this field. Therefore, benefits of the individual
    company also have a positive effect on the broad public.
    <br><br>
    <b>Does the BSCI provide a certification?</b>
    <br><br>
    The BSCI is not a certification system and therefore does not issue a certificate. The BSCI provides a specific
    process with uniform management instruments for Members, suppliers, auditors and qualifiers. This approach ensures
    uniform audit procedures and evaluation and therefore comparability of the results. <br>
    If I do not get a certificate what do I receive as proof of the audit?<br>
    The cover page of the audit report outlining the results and the validity of the audit can be displayed in the
    factory premises and be used as proof of the audit. <br><br>

    <b>Which products are covered by the BSCI?</b>
    <br><br>
    Audits within the BSCI can be conducted in any production facility worldwide. <br>
    The type of articles covered by the BSCI varies widely. There are quite a number of department stores as members,
    who sell all sorts of soft goods, clothing, home textiles, small appliances, toys, and accessories. There are also
    members that focus on one particular product group, for example clothing stores, shoe retailers, baby products, or
    sports goods. For the implementation of the BSCI in the food industry, the BSCI has developed a special module for
    the primary production (farms) <br><br>
